        <a name="summary"></a><h4>What's this all about?</h4>
        <p>A real estate development company has purchased three empty lots on the corner of N. Eastern Avenue and Lombardy Street in El Sereno and is now attempting to get the land rezoned to build a café, a 20-unit apartment complex and a 500-student charter school.</p>

        <a name="opposition"></a><h4>That doesn't sound so bad. Why are the residents opposing it?</h4>
        <p>This plan raises a lot of issues (<a href="/#docs" title="">which are outlined in a fact sheet</a>), but here are a few of the big ones:</p>
        <ol>
			<li><strong>This area is zoned for single-family homes.</strong><br />
			And it was zoned as such for a reason. A lot of bad things happen to neighborhoods and their infrastructure when they're suddenly transformed from low residential to commercial and high-density residential.</li>
			<li><strong>The landscape will be permanently altered.</strong><br />
			Building a few single-family homes or condos on the empty land would fit right in with the rest of the area. But a monstrous school and apartment complex built up on the hill will tower over the entire area.</li>
			<li><strong>Traffic, safety and pollution.</strong><br />
			There are two other schools at the same intersection as the proposed build site, and high traffic volume already presents safety hazards for the children in the area. The government studies conducted for the developers have said that these issues will only get worse if this project goes through as planned.</li>
		</ol>
                
        <!--<a name="support"></a><h4>Oh come on, it can't be all bad. Can it?</h4>
		<p>There are some potential benefits that the developers have put forth.</p>
		
		<p><strong>The developer's biggest selling point is the proposed charter school.</strong> Which makes sense, no one is against more options for parents and a better education for our children. But there are several other locations in El Sereno that have the infrastructure to support a school and are already appropriately zoned. On top of that, there's no actual school. It's just a "proposal." There is no guarantee that once the land is re-zoned there will actually be a school built there.</p>
		
		<p><strong>A cafe could be kind of nice.</strong> But have you ever heard of a two-story, 2,000 square foot cafe that only has six parking spaces? Sounds a little fishy. And there are already several nearby cafes in commercially-zoned areas. Just as the city of Los Angeles and it's residents intended.</p>
		
		<p><strong>The developer's story on the apartment complex keeps changing.</strong> First they were townhomes. Then they were apartments to house international students attending the school. Then they were apartments for the faculty of the school. Those may sound good. But the reality is that these will end up being a focal point for law enforcement just like the other apartment complexes in the area.</p>-->

        
		<a name="developers"></a><h4>Who's behind the Eastern Lombardy development project?</h4>
		<p>The developers that have purchased the land are <strong>Bancomer Construction &amp; Development, Inc.</strong>, <strong>City Terrace, LLC</strong>, and <strong>Paramount Villas, LLC</strong>.</p>
		
		<h4>Okay, but seriously, who is that?</h4>
		<p>The matrix of holding corporations and LLCs is actually owned by a local family. <strong>Al Vanegaz</strong> is the President of Bancomer Construction &amp; Development. <strong>Alvaro Banegas</strong> is a Member at City Terrace, LLC and a Principal at Paramount Villas, LLC. <strong>Claudia Pichardo Banegas</strong>, the wife of Alvaro Banegas, is also Member at Paramount Villas, LLC as well as a Member at Bancomer Construction &amp; Development, Inc. <strong>Erika Banegas Morales</strong>, the daughter of  Alvaro Banegas and Claudia Pichardo Banegas, is the Director of Development at Bancomer, Construction &amp; Development, Inc. and has been the face of the project at public hearings.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Kate Bartolo</strong> is the President of Kate Bartolo &amp; Associates, a former aide in the District 2 City Council office, and is now a Development and Land Use Consultant. Bartolo was hired by Bancomer to obtain a CUP (Conditional Use Permit), as she has for many of her other clients. Bartolo is registered as a lobbyist with the City of Los Angeles and her reported list of clients include Bancomer Construction &amp; Development, Inc. and Avance Schools, Inc.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Ricardo Mireles</strong> is the Executive Director for Avance Schools, Inc. and was contracted by Bancomer to <a href="http://www.academiaavance.com/home/gov/meetings/avanceexecutiveboard-meetingofjune62013400pm" title="Minutes from June 6, 2013 Academia Avance board meeting" target="_blank">advise them</a> on the design of their proposed charter school.
