							<blockquote>
								<p>On Tuesday, July 30, 2013, around 5:30 p.m, a man was riding his bicycle on the 5200 block of Templeton Street, when two suspects driving a tan Toyota 4Runner drove past the pedestrian and suddenly stopped their vehicle. The two suspects came out of the 4Runner and fired numerous shots. The pedestrian speeding away on his bicycle was hit by the gunfire. The victim was treated and release at a local hospital for a non-life threatening wounds.</p>
								
								<p>Detectives are investigating this shooting as possible gang related and believe somebody can identify the suspects based on the surveillance video.</p>

							<h4><a name="20130808"></a>Continuance Granted by City Planning Commission</h4>
							<p class="date">August 8, 2013</p>
							
							<p>At a public hearing held Thursday, August 8, at City Hall the City Planning Commission (CPC) heard public comment on the proposed Eastern and Lombardy project, as well as a request for a continuance from the developer Mr. Al Banegas.</p>
							
							<p>The commission "reluctantly" granted the continuance request, but not before offering stern criticism of the applicant's proposal.</p>
							
							<p>In introducing the project, CPC President William Roschen described the project as "struggling" and added "there are many things that I think are disturbing about the project... Hopefully this next project will be more considerate." After allowing public comments to be given for the record despite the commission's decision to not make a recommendation on the project, Commissioner Dana Perlman quipped that the hillside project will have "a real uphill battle to get approved" and shared that he has "grave concerns about the project as presented." He continued, "there is a lot of work to be done on this project before it could ever get through the commission."</p>
							
							<p>Roschen, too, added "When I reviewed the plan I had many concerns about the project. I hope the revised project will be more thoughtful."</p>
							
							<p>In a letter submitted to the CPC, Mr. Banegas said he has requested the continuance in order to "step back and both re-think the project and perform [sic] additional community outreach." The developer will now have 75 days to return to the CPC with revised plans.</p>

							<h4><a name="20130807"></a>LA-32 NC General Board Meeting</h4>
							<p class="date">August 7, 2013</p>
							
							<p>The Eastern/Lombardy project was the subject of two agenda items at the August 7th LA-32 Neighborhood Council General Board Meeting. The first was to rescind the previous board's letter of support for the project from 2012, prior to the plan revisions that lead to the project's current incarnation. The second was to issue a new letter in either support or opposition to the project.</p>
							
							<p>In a contentious meeting where the board added to it's reputation of being rather dysfunctional, both items resulted in a 5-5 vote with four abstentions. Thus, no stance or action was taken on either item.</p>
							
							
							<p>Below are videos of the meeting.</p>

							<h4><a name="20130726"></a>LA-32 NC Special Meeting Recap</h4>
							<p class="date">July 26, 2013</p>
							
							<p>At last night's special meeting of the LA-32 Neighborhood Council to address the proposed hillside development at Eastern Avenue and Lombardy Blvd in El Sereno, over 80 members of the community attended with an overwhelming majority speaking against the proposed project.</p>
							
							<p>The special meeting of the LA-32 Board was called at the request of the community immediately impacted by the proposed project, the majority of whom had not been aware of the proposal until receiving Public Hearing notices from the City of Los Angeles Planning Department last month.</p>
							
							<p>Al Banagas, owner of Bancomer Construction and Development, described the project while projecting slides of project renderings on the wall of the Barrio Action gymnasium on Huntington Drive in El Sereno.</p> 
							
							<p>With the first image &mdash; a graphic depicting the hilltop development from the approximate view point of Eastern Avenue at Klamath &mdash; an audible gasp was heard from the audience.  Despite pouring over the city documents related to the project, and working to understand the plan-view diagram and two graphic depictions of building facades in the brochure distributed by Bancomer this month, the audience was clearly shocked by the immensity of the buildings as shown.</p>
							
							<p>Mr. Banegas quickly criticized the graphics, saying it wasn't as bad as it looked, and flipped through the remainder of the slides, coming to rest on a slightly less impactful aerial view of the proposed structure while he completed his review.</p>
							
							<p>One point of contention was Mr. Banegas' insistence that the 20 unit housing is proposed to be owner-occupied townhomes, not rental apartments. <a href="http://90032.org/docs/bancomer-mitigated-negative-declaration.pdf" title="Bancomer Mitigated Negative Declaration" target="_blank">Documents obtained from the Department of Planning</a> describe the residential component as "<em>20 unit live work residential townhome-style apartments</em>."  A member of the audience pointed to the recently distributed <a href="http://90032.org/docs/bancomer-eastern-lombardy-brochure.pdf" title="Bancomer Brochure" target="_blank">marketing brochure produced and distributed by Bancomer</a> that describes the 2-story housing units as "available for rent at market rate" and provides a site plan on which the housing is labeled as "<em>20 Units Apartment Complex</em>."</p>
							
							<p>Despite being granted only 60 seconds each, every community member who stood to speak communicated intelligently, thoughtfully and passionately.  Concerns included the number of existing empty commercial and residential structures already in the community, the unsuitability of a project that relies on so many significant variances to existing policy, increased traffic, and issues of safety both during the multi-year construction period and in the future given the stretched resources of area fire and police staff.  One speaker expressed anger at having to fight development off of El Sereno's hillsides saying that Northeast LA's more affluent communities of Mt. Washington and Silverlake are not targeted in the same way. Most often cited was the developer's failure to comply with the area's protective <a href="http://90032.org/docs/ne-hillsides-zone-change-ordinance.pdf" title="Northeast LA Hillsides Zoning Ordinance" target="_blank">Northeast LA Hillsides Ordinance</a> and his requests for variance to key elements of the Ordinance.</p>
							
							<p>Many community members had hoped the LA-32 Board would vote at this meeting on whether to revoke approval of the project issued by a previous Board in 2012. However, the required amount of board members to make up a quorum were not present. The LA-32 Board's Executive Committee will meet next week, Wednesday, July 31st, at 6:00 PM in the Barrio Action Center gymnasium, 4927 Huntington Drive North. Members of the community are invited to attend.</p>
							
							<p>Staffers from the CD14 office of Jose Huizar, an <a href="http://josehuizarblog.blogspot.com/2010/06/historic-ground-breaking-for-ascot.html" title="Jose Huizar: Historic Ground-Breaking for Ascot Hills Park" target="_blank">active proponent of hillside preservation</a> and key in the development of the Northeast LA Hillsides Ordinance, were in attendance to hear the community's concerns and direct requests to deny re-zoning of this El Sereno hillside.  Kevin Ocubillo, the Councilman's Planning Deputy, outlined next steps saying that the policy decision to grant or deny a re-zoning request is made by the City Council.  The project will be reviewed by the City's Planning Commission at an August 8th meeting, the City's Council's Planning and Land Use Management Committee (date TBA), and finally the City Council (date also TBA). The public is welcome to attend each of the meetings.</p>

							<h4><a name="20130722"></a>LA-32 NC Special Meeting of the Board</h4>
							<p class="date">July 22, 2013</p>
							
							
							<p>On July 25 at 6:00 PM the LA-32 Neighborhood Council will be holding a special meeting at the Barrio Action Center at 4927 Huntington Drive to review the proposed Eastern &amp; Lombardy project.</p>
							
							<p>There has been some speculation that some members of the Neighborhood Council will not show up to the meeting in an attempt to prevent the council from voting against the project, thereby overturning their previous votes in favor of the project.</p>
							
							<p>In light of this LA-32 Neighborhood Council President, Connie Castro, sent the following email last Friday to remind the other council members of the responsibilities associated with their elected office (emphasis hers):</p>
							
							
							<blockquote>
								<p>From: Connie Castro<br />
								To: LA-32 NC Board Members<br />
								Sent: Friday, July 19, 2013 9:31 PM<br />
								Subject: LA-32 NC Special Meeting of the Board June 25 at 6PM Barrio Action</p>

								<p>I hope this email finds you well.  As President and presiding officer of the LA-32 Neighborhood Council and in consultation with the City Attorney and the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment,  I am calling for a Special Meeting of the new LA-32 NC Board in place to discuss the Development on 2520-2668 North Eastern Avenue (Case No. CPC-2011-3128-GPA-ZC-HD) the construction of a Charter Elementary Students (530 students), a 20 Unit multi-family residential structure and a Commercial Space (café), said property is currently zoned Residential.</p>
								
								<p>The LA-32 Neighborhood Council  has received numerous emails and comments from both the Developer and the Residents being impacted by this project. As you are all aware it is our obligation to inform and educate, to the greatest extent possible, all Stakeholders of forthcoming projects and diligently outreach to the diverse members of the community.  Lets not forget that the purpose of LA-32 NC is to participate as a body on issues concerning our neighborhood and represent the interest of all LA-32 NC members ("Stakeholders") regarding issues affecting the LA-32 NC area. As such our responsibility as board members is to promote and enhance civic participation and community affairs ensuring the opportunity for diverse interests to participate in those affairs of the community.</p>
								
								<p>Renewed community interest and increased stakeholder participation in regards to this project deserve our <strong>immediate attention</strong> to this matter.</p>  
								
								<p>Please plan on attending this very important meeting.  The Board will entertain a motion from Board members on whether to support, oppose, or take no position on the proposed project.  The meeting will take place this upcoming <strong>Thursday July 25, 2013 at Barrio Action</strong>. <strong>Please arrive on time as the meeting will begin promptly at 6pm</strong>.</p>
