lede: The story of how Preserve El Sereno got started

content:

<p><strong>Preserve El Sereno is the story of a community taking action.</strong> In June of 2013 neighbors in the area around Eastern Avenue and Lombardy Boulevard received notice of a proposed project nearby. A construction project that would have dramatically changed El Sereno and set a distressing precedent for development in other hillside neighborhoods. They spoke with other neighbors, organized, held private meetings, went door-to-door collecting petition signatures, attending public meetings, passing out fliers, using the Internet and social media to inform the community. All along the way, day-by-day, week-by-week the group grew in size, and the community became more united in their purpose. To preserve the hillsides in their community.</p>
							
<p>Over time the community gained the attention, respect and support of local and city elected officials. The project was turned away and the developer was <em>sent back to the drawing board</em>. For some, that might be the end of the story. But for the hundreds of members of Preserve El Sereno that was just the start.</p>
